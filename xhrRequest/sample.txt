AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. It's a way of retrieving data from a server after a webpage has loaded. Asynchronous means the process that triggers the request runs independently from the source code. Because of that, you have to track and
 manage the request and its subsequent response.

After completing this lesson, you will be able to:

Make AJAX requests using the XHR object and the fetch API
Interpret server status codes
Handle AJAX server responses
